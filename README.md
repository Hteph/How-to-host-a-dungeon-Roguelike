# How-to-host-a-dungeon-Roguelike
A project to implement the inspiring "How to host a Dungeon" (http://tonydowler.com/projects/how-to-host-a-dungeon/) using the codebase from the excellent tutorial from http://trystans.blogspot.se/search/label/roguelike%20tutorial

When I finish the tutorial I thinking of changing the graphic Lib to SquidLib (https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib).
